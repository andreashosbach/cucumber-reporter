# cucumber-scenarioo-plugin

*Generate Scenarioo documentation from cucumber tests.*

## Using the plugin

### Add the dependency to your pom.xml

Currently you have to download and compile the sources locally first.

	<dependency>
    	<groupId>com.github.andreashosbach</groupId>
		<artifactId>cucumber-scenarioo-plugin</artifactId>
		<version>0.3.0</version>
	</dependency>

### Create a configuration file

Create a file in json format with the following data:
 
    {
        "outputDirectory": "target/scenarioo/selenium",
        "branchName": "My Branch Name",
        "branchDescription":"My branch description",
        "revision": "1.0"
    } 

### Add the plugin to the Cucumber test runner

    @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
    @CucumberOptions(  ...
        plugin = "com.github.andreashosbach.cucumber_scenarioo_plugin.CucumberScenariooPlugin:resources/cucumber_scenarioo_config.json"
    ...)

After the *:* in the plugin configuration give the path to the configuration file.

### Define an after step hook where you take a screenshot and save it with Screenshot.save(...)
  
Example with Selenium:
  
    @AfterStep
    public void afterStep() {
        TakesScreenshot scrShot = ((TakesScreenshot) webDriver);
        Screenshot.save(webDriver.getTitle(), scrShot.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.BYTES));
    }

Currently you can  have only one after step hook, otherwise the steps are written twice.
(While you can also take the screenshot in the step itself, you have to make sure that for every step there is a screenshot 
saved in the same order as the steps are executed. But there has to be an after step event to trigger the writing of the 
step in the plugin.)

### Configuration

By default the branch name is *branch* and build names are *Build-yyyy-MM-dd-hh-mm-ss* generated by the default name generators.
This behaviour can be changed by implementing custom name generators.


## Feature Files
Guidelines on how to write the *feature files* 

### Description
The descriptions of *features* and *scenarios* are formatted as following:
* The first line of a description is the *short description* and will be displayed in lists
* The whole description (including the first line) is formatted as markdown and visible in the detail under *Long Description*

## Scenarioo

The results can be displayed with [Scenarioo](http://scenarioo.org/)
